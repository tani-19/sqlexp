create tables customers;

insert into customer values (cid,cname,cage,caddress);
WITH 4 VALUES
select * from customers;

create view customers_view as select cname, age from customers;

select * from customers_view;

update customers_view set age=19 where cname="Praty";

select * from customers_view;

delete from customers_view where cname="Devyani";

select * from customers;

drop view customers_view;

select * from customers;

Hence, we understood the concept of view and performed DDL,DML commands
on the view using MySQL server.
